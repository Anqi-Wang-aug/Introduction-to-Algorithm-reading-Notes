Index:
1. Fundation: refers to "Fundation" section of the book
   * insertion_sort.cpp: aprogram demonstrates insertion algorithm (in c++)
   * Growth_of_Functions.pdf: my printed note on "Growth of Functions"
   * Growth_of_Functions.tex: still my note on "Growth of Functions", but in latex (raw note
   * atb.png: an example of asymptotic tight bond. Used in notes. Pic from online sources
   * main: compiled insertion_sort.cpp. run it by ./main with several numbers
